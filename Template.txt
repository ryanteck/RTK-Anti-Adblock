<h4>Welcome To <<Website Name Here>>! You have been brought here from where you have been detected using Adblock or a similar plugin.<br/>
This is because to run this site and the others that my servers host it costs money! How do I get money to pay for the servers? Adverts!<br/><br/>
This page itself uses little bandwidth and resources  and is your alternative for using Adblock. <br/> <br/>To access the site please Don't run AdBlock on *.ryanteck.org.uk/* , You will only see one advert on a page, and it's not in the way of the content!
