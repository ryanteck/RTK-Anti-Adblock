#RTK Anti Adblock

This is a simple little script, a HTML document and a template designed to send people who use adblock to a different page (Using low bandwidth and preventing them from accessing the content).

If you like people removing the Adverts that make your site gain money then don't use this code! If you like people removing your adverts from your site making you lose money, Use it!

This is my first main Github project that is designed for public use. If you find a bug just contact me via Twitter (@Ryanteck) or file a bug report.

Also visit my website @ http://blog.ryanteck.org.uk and maybe even donate!

Thanks - 
Ryan
